# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

This repository is created to fulfill the Code Versioning Workshop Homework and to get hands-on practice on git environment.

What have been done here:
1. Created the repository
2. Added summary of branching and merging concept gained from the workshop
3. Completed the commit at least 5 times to the repository
4. Branched the main repository into experiment branch and feature branch
5. Merged the feature->experiment, experiment->main branch
6. Tried the pull request function on github and merged experimentation (again) into main branch
7. Invited my peers to collaborate on the repository
8. Updated the README.md file

The author faced some challange during the assignment such as:
1. Pushed the wrong commit into the github, and how to rollback the version on the github (Pushing the wrong commit can be bad for the team and such a hassle so that the author learned to be extra cautious before pushing the wrong commit into any branch)
2. How to change commit message after the commit is pushed into the repository.

There is no other significant challanges in this assignment as the git commands can be found on git documentation and the use cases can be found by doing google search.
