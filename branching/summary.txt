# Branching is one of the method in git to make a copy of a version.
# Branching usually done when we going to do some experimentation or adding new feature.

# Branching concept is to make a branch copy of the main branch of the code.
# By Branching the main code we can edit the code in the main branch
# without changing anything in the main branch.

# After done with the feature or any edit on the branch, 
# we can do a pull request, so that our code can be reviewed and get feedback from the reviewer.
# After the changes are reviewed and safe to merge to the main branch.
# People with the proper repository access will be able to accept the pull
# request and the code on the branch will be merge with the main branch.
